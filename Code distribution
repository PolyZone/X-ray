Under the first 13- weeks we all did all of the code. 
This means that we all made a baseline model, we all made a deep ensemble model and we also all made a SWA and SWAG.
This was done so that we all learnt as much about the models as possible.

Then time was running out and the 3 weeks began we decided to split the work more up so one did some plot, one did some cross validation and one did some more test and Multi-SWAG
This was decided to be this way early in the 3 weeks so that we could get more in the report.

This means that all the code from of Baseline, deep ensamble, SWA and SWAG could bed uploaded by any of us but is ofcause distributed out between us.
